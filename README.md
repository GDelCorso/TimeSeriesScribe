## Creation of the executable file

An executable script (.exe) can be made with the use of the python package PyInstaller. To create the executable script run the following lines in a prompt terminal inside the cloned folder of the repository:

if you don't have PyInstaller installed then install it as follows
- pip install PyInstaller 

to create the executable copy and paste the follow line in the terminal
- python -m PyInstaller -F GUI_TimeSeriesScribe.py

The last sentence will create two folders: build and dist. Inside the dist folder the executable file is created (GUI_TimeSeriesScribe.exe). Executable can then be moved to the desired location.
